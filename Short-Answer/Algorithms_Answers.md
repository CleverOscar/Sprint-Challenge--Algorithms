#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime for this function is O(n^3), as n is the size of the input. The higher polynomial order of 'n^3' will dominate the 'n^2' for larger inputs. As the while loop is running on the order of 'n^3' 

b)This block of code would be 'O(n log n), where the size of n (operations). because the 
'for' loop runs 'n' times, for a runtime of O(n). 'j' inside the 'while' loop is doubling rather than incrementing, resulting in runtime of 'O( log n)'. For nested loops, we want to multiply the runtime complexities, so we would combine the runetime complexity of 'O(n log n)

c)The runtime complexity of this block of code would be O(n) (linear), where n is bunnies. This block of code demonstrates recursion and will run n times, decrementing bunnies down to the base case value of zero.
